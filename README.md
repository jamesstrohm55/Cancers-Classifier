# üß¨ Cancer Classifier ‚Äì Logistic Regression from Scratch

This project implements a **logistic regression model from scratch** to classify cancer types using gene expression data. It includes manual computation of forward and backward propagation using the **sigmoid activation function** and gradient descent optimization.

---

## üìå Objective

To build a custom logistic regression model using only NumPy, showcasing how cancer classification can be performed at a low level without relying on machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.

## üß† Key Concepts

- Manual implementation of:
  - **Forward propagation** to compute predictions
  - **Backward propagation** to compute gradients
  - **Sigmoid activation** function
  - **Gradient descent** for optimization
- Binary cancer classification using gene expression levels
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for visualization and dimensionality reduction
